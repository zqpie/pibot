# Raspberry pi smart video car V2



This code is designed to run on a raspberry pi, it has been tested on a pi zero and a pi 3b+ so it should work on all pis. This software is made to run while connected to a sunfounder smart video car kit V2. It is recommended to do the pi library setup that the sunfounder kit instructs you to do, there may be libraries for the motor controllers. while you are pip installing the picar repo, and maybe curses, you should also install the inputs module if you want xbox controller support. Soon I will implement software to use the car's camera. although currently you can control the gimbal on select software.

Thank You and have a great day.
